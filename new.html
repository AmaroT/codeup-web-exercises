    <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> stands for             HyperText Markup Language.</p>
        <p>It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains        the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information       that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't            explicitly show to the user.</p>
    <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>
        <p>These are called element tags.</p>
        <p>They inform the browser how to display the page.</p>
    <p>They look like this:</p>
    <div>
        <p>They almost always come with a closing tag somewhere later that looks        like this: </p>
    </div>
        <p>Whatever is between the opening tag and the closing tag is called an         element. Let's create some...</p>
        <p>In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in         an &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
        And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.
